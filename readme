Summer Activities Visualization for College Students
This project visualizes different ways college students can maximize their summer break. We create various types of plots using Python, including 3D plots and interactive plots, to represent data related to internships, volunteering, summer jobs, summer classes, and career exploration. Each plot is styled with appealing colors to enhance readability and engagement.
